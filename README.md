🧠 AI & ML Internship – Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
📌 Objective

The goal of this task is to clean and preprocess raw data to make it suitable for machine learning models. I used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle for this task.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Pandas – for data manipulation
NumPy – for numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization
Scikit-learn – for feature scaling

🔍 Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset and explored its structure using head(), info(), and describe().
Handled missing values using mean for numerical features and mode for categorical ones.
Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
Detected and removed outliers using boxplots and IQR method.
Standardized numerical features like Age and Fare using StandardScaler.
Saved the cleaned dataset as cleaned_titanic.csv for further use.

📈 Outcome

A clean and preprocessed Titanic dataset ready for use in ML models. This task improved my understanding of:
Handling missing data
Encoding categorical features
Normalizing and standardizing numerical data
Outlier detection and removal
